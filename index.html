<h2><a name="Problem Statement">Problem Statement</a></h2> 

<p>In this pandemic situation the infected people are increasing day by day it is happening due to lack of awareness among peoples.so here we are representing the situation in the data visualization which helps to easily understand our situation among people . This will automatically reduce the infected people. We are doing this by using python and matplotlib(module).</p>

	<h1><a name="About Project">INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT</a></h1>
	<p>The virus is spreading  from person to person through small respiratory droplets. When a person coughs or sneezes, these droplets can also land on nearby surfaces.The number of people being affected by the covid-19 can be visualized using python and matplotlib. In our present situation, knowing the spread of covid-19 is very much important for us . This project helps in giving the statistical analysis of spread of covid-19.This study will focus on drawing insights from publicly available data and statistics on the Coronavirus. The data that will be considered for the study are aggregated COVID-19 patient statistics like daily cases, deaths, recoveries, testing data, etc. Python has been used for carrying out the analysis. With of help of modules like matplotlib and NumPy data visualization can be performed .The data set that are being created will show destruction created by this virus for 100 days . On increase in days the changes being affected by this virus will be seen . At the beginning  the virus spread will more due to which the death ratio  is also higher . But slowly the death ratio goes down and recovery will at higher rate. All this is shown in data visualization .
</p>
<h1>METHODOLOGY ADOPTED</h1>
<p><b>Assigning  the input data in form of Dictionaries (Covid19_PARMS)</b>
<br>
<b>Creating the Class called virus():</b>
<br>
<b>Create plot:</b>
Here we label the x and y axis for graphical representation of our stimulation with help of NumPy.<br>
<b>Create annotations:</b><br>
<b>Day:</b>
Here we represent numbers of days the virus spread is shown by changing the time delay . <br>
<b>Infected:</b>
Infected for that particular day in red color(dots) in Create data visualization .<br>
<b>Deaths:</b>
Deaths for that particular day in black color(dots) in .Create data visualization. <br>
<b>Recovered:</b>
Recovered for that particular day in green color(dots) in Create data visualization .

<h1>Creating the polar plot with (0,r):</h1>
<img id="img" src="polar.png">
<p>Polar coordinates are points labeled (r,θ)(r,θ) and plotted on a polar grid. The polar grid is represented as a series of concentric circles radiating out from the pole, or the origin of the coordinate plane</p>
<h1>Validation of code in vs code</h1>

<p>Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control. It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE</p>

	<h1>SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT</h1>

<p>The project code is simulated in VSCODE simulator and Terminal.
The libraries used are Matplotlib and NumPy.</p>

<h2>Matplotlib:</h2>
<p>Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static , animated , and interactive visualizations in Python. This was originally developed by John D. Hunter. Their main aim was to provide best GUI.</p>

<h2>Comparison With Matlab</h2>

<p>Matplotlib is a Python library that draws graphs that look extremely similar to Matlab. Matplotlib is used in Python which is general purpose programming language. So these can used for developing models .Matplotlib is open-source software which is free .Matlab is numerical computing system that offers an integrated development environment with its own programming  language (written in c, c++ and java). Matlab is not open-source software Both are used by Data Scientist or Data analyst  for statistical  analysis.</p>

<h2>NumPy:</h2>
<p>NumPy stands for Numerical Python. NumPy is a python library used for working with arrays or list which stores the data .It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra , fourier transform ,  and matrices. NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphnat . It is an open source we can use it freely .</p>

<h1>REALISTIC CONTENT AND DELIVERABLE</h1>
<ul>
	<li>The data of the spread of virus for  100 days.</li>
	<li>The recovery time of effected person.</li>
	<li>The number of deaths caused due to this covid-19.</li>
	<li>The rate of increase in number of people affected.</li>
</ul>

<h1><a name="Conclusion">CONCLUSION</a></h1>

<p>During simulation and visualization ,we learned how to generate beautiful data visualizations using  Covid-19 datasets. 
We aimed to use this information available and create this data visualization to show the strength  of visual Data.
This helps people  in understanding and taking action on this pandemic situation .</p>
